# Singapore Resale Flat Prices Predicting
## Overview
This project allows users to explore Singapore flat resale prices. After retrieving and cleaning the data, insights are gained through exploratory data analysis (EDA). Various regression models are then used to predict resale prices, and the final model is deployed on a user-friendly Render platform.

# Approach
```Data Collection```: Extract Singapore Resale data from your local directory. 

```Data Cleaning```: Perform pre-processing methods like Data handling is applied to the collected data.

```Statistical Analysis```: Cleaned numerical data has been analysed to get a valuable insights.

```EDA Analysis```: The cleaned data has been analyzed using various exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques, revealing insights into current trends.

```Setup the Streamlit app```: Streamlit is a user-friendly web development tool that simplifies the process of creating intuitive interfaces.

```Data Analysis```: Cleaned data has been analyzed and visualized in Streamlit through Pandas DataFrame and Plotly.

```Machine Learning```: Cleaned data has been applied in different machine learning algorithm to predict the resale price.

The provided code utilizes Python scripting along with various libraries to fetch data from the our local directory. Data manipulation techniques are then applied, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the cleaned dataset to extract meaningful insights. Furthermore, the implementation includes a Streamlit web application to enhance user friendly dashboard and deployed in Render Platform.

Here's a breakdown of what the code does:
- Importing all the neccessary libraries includes ```Streamlit``` which creates UI to interact with user and display the analysed data, ```Pandas``` which helps to display the analysed data in Streamlit web,```numpy``` which will help in mathematical conversion,```Plotly```  is employed to visualize the data and gain insights from it,```Scipy``` aids in conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) and extracting valuable insights, ```category_encoders``` used to convert categorical values to numerical data,```pickle``` is used to load the trained model.
```bash
import pandas as pd
import category_encoders as ce
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import spearmanr
import scipy.stats as stats
import streamlit as st
import pickle
import plotly.express as px
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots
import plotly.graph_objects as go
```
- ```Datacoll_dataclean``` file is responsible for fetching data from the local directory and performing necessary data cleaning operations. **Note: Replace your file name in ```df1,df2,df3,df4,df5,df6```**
```bash
df1 = pd.read_csv('please provide the file name here')
df2 = pd.read_csv('please provide the file name here')
df3 = pd.read_csv('please provide the file name here')
df4 = pd.read_csv('please provide the file name here')
df5 = pd.read_csv('please provide the file name here')
df6 = pd.read_csv('please provide the file name here')
```
- ```analysis``` file is responsible for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and extracting valuable insights.
- ```Dataextract_visual``` file is used to display the predicted data from ML model and display over the streamlit dashboard.
- Four separate tabs have been implemented in the Streamlit web application to facilitate user interaction and enhance data visualization for insightful analysis.
```bash
tab1, tab2, tab3, tab4= st.tabs(["Home", "Statistical Insights","EDA Insights","Visual Insights"])
```
- In Tab1 of the Streamlit web application,Users can input various data to receive the corresponding predicted Resale price.
- In Tab2, Cleaned data has undergone Statistical analysis procedure to get a valuable insights.
- In Tab3, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted on the dataset to extract valuable insights, which are then presented to the user for further analysis and interpretation.
- In Tab4, Cleaned data has been analyzed, and visualized to extract valuable insights.

This Python script streamlines the process of fetching data from a local directory, implementing crucial data cleaning procedures, visualized and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract valuable insights. Analysed data was applied on ML to predict Flat resale price.
